== Description ==

The Bonway Portfolio Editor is a simple and robust plugin that lets you edit simple portfolio entries which can be used all throughout your website by copying and pasting the generated shortcodes.
All the options might seem daunting but it is all to make sure you, the user, are in control:

* The **General** block allows you to set the identifier used for the shortcode, and the overlay's class used for custom styling purposes
* The **Read more** block allows you to control wether or not you want the text to be cut off and a "Read more" button to be present.
* The **Colours** block lets you determine the colours used
* The **Banner** block speaks for itself: Here you can choose the banner image for a single item
